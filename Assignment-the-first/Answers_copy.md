## Part 2
1. Define the problem

Create an algorithm to demultiplex paired-end sequencing reads using two index FASTQ files and a list of 24 known index sequences. The algorithm must:

    Sort read pairs into:

        Correctly matched index-pairs (R1 + R2 FASTQ file for each unique index-pair)

        Index-hopped pairs (wrong but known index combinations)

        Reads with unknown indexes (either not in the known list or containing ambiguous bases like N, or below quality threshold)

    Annotate read headers with the index-pair used (e.g. @SEQ_ID AAAAAAAA-TTTTTTTT).

    Report statistics:

        Read-pair count per matched index-pair

        Total count of index-hopped reads

        Total count of unknown index(es)

2. Describe output

Inputs

    R1.fastq â€” forward biological reads

    R4.fastq â€” reverse biological reads

    R2.fastq â€” index1 read (forward index)

    R3.fastq â€” index2 read (reverse index, needs to be reverse complemented)

    known_indexes.txt â€” list of 24 known index sequences (8bp each, A/C/G/T only)

Outputs

    Demultiplexed FASTQ files:

        For each valid matched index-pair (24 x 24 = 576 possibilities, but only write files for pairs found), create:

            R1_index1-index2.fastq

            R2_index1-index2.fastq

        For index-hopped reads (known I1 and I2, but mismatched pair):

            R1_indexhopped.fastq, R2_indexhopped.fastq

        For unknown reads (invalid/unknown/N/low-quality indexes):

            R1_unknown.fastq, R2_unknown.fastq

    Annotated headers:

        Modify read headers in all output FASTQs to include the index pair: @SEQ_ID index1-index2

    Summary report (printed or saved as .txt):

        Count of properly matched reads per index pair

        Total index-hopped read count

        Total unknown index count

3. Upload your [4 input FASTQ files](../TEST-input_FASTQ) and your [>=6 expected output FASTQ files](../TEST-output_FASTQ).

# ðŸ“„ Demultiplexing Algorithm Overview

This document outlines the logic and steps for implementing a demultiplexing algorithm that processes Illumina paired-end FASTQ data with dual indexes.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Open the Input Files

- One file for **Read 1** (biological read)
- One file for **Read 2** (biological read)
- One file for **Index 1** (forward index)
- One file for **Index 2** (reverse index)
- One file containing the list of **valid index sequences**

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Load Valid Indexes

- Read and store all valid indexes from the index list file into memory (e.g., a set) for fast lookup.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Initialize Counters and Tracking Structures

- A counter for **each valid index-pair** to track matched reads.
- A counter for **total index-hopped reads**.
- A nested table or dictionary to track **incorrect index pairings** (e.g., `index1:index2` mismatches).
- A counter for **unknown or low-quality index reads**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Process Input FASTQ Records

- Read **one complete record (4 lines)** from each of the four input FASTQ files.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Extract Index Sequences

- From the Index 1 and Index 2 records:
  - **Reverse complement** the Index 2 sequence.
  - Compare against the list of known valid indexes.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Check for "Unknown" Indexes

Mark a read pair as **unknown** if:
- Either index sequence contains invalid characters (e.g., `'N'`)
- OR either index is not in the list of known indexes
- OR either index has an **average quality score below the threshold**

**Actions:**
- Mark the read as `"unknown"`
- Increment the unknown counter
- Skip further classification and go to writing output

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Classify the Read Pair

- If `Index 1 == reverse_complement(Index 2)`:
  - Mark the read as **"matched"**
  - Increment the matched counter for that **index-pair**
- Else:
  - Mark the read as **"index-hopped"**
  - Increment the **hopped counter**
  - Track the **specific mismatch** combination (e.g., Aâ†’B)

---

## ðŸ”¹ 8. Annotate Headers

- Append the `index1-index2` pair to the **header line** of both Read 1 and Read 2.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 9. Write to Output Files

- **Matched:** Write to files named after the index-pair (e.g., `R1_AAAAAAAT-TTTTTTTT.fq`)
- **Index-Hopped:** Write to general `indexhopped` files.
- **Unknown:** Write to general `unknown` files.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 10. Repeat Until All Records Are Processed

- Continue steps 4â€“9 until the end of all four input FASTQ files is reached.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 11. Generate Final Report

- For each matched index-pair:
  - Output the total number of **properly matched** reads
- Output the total number of **index-hopped** reads
- Output the **frequency of each mismatched index-pair**
- Output the total number of **unknown** reads

5. High level functions. For each function, be sure to include:
    1. Description/doc string
    2. Function headers (name and parameters)
    3. Test examples for individual functions
